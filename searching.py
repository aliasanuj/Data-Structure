Searching :
==============
Searching for data stored in different data structures is a crucial part of pretty much every single
application. There are many different algorithms available to utilize when searching, and each have different
implementations and rely on different data structures to get the job done. Being able to choose a specific
algorithm for a given task is a key skill for developers and can mean the difference between a fast,
reliable and stable application and an application that crumbles from a simple request.
